*** <<a4-tests>> Automated Testing Instructions
Unzip ~a4-tests.zip~ to create the directory ~a4-tests/~.  Copy all
files in the ~a4-tests~ directory to the project directory
~a4-code~. The following unix command should do this if ~a4-tests~ and
a4-code are in the same directory.

: cp -r a4-tests/* a4-code/

The Makefile provided is a copy of Makefile.withtests. The original
version is called Makefile.notests.

The new Makefile introduces the targets
- ~make test-p1~  : test problem 1
- ~make test-p2~  : test problem 2
- ~make test-p3~  : test problem 3
- ~make test~  : test all problems

Test programs ~test_ssmap~, ~test_treemap~, ~test_map_modules~, and
~test_treeset~ associated with problems 1-3 can run individual tests
by passing a test number as a command line argument as in

: ./test_treeset 3    # run the 3rd test only
