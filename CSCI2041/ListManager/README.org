*** <<a2-tests>> Automated Testing Instructions
Unzip ~a2-tests.zip~ to create the directory ~a2-tests/~.  Copy all
files in the ~a2-tests~ directory to the project directory
~a2-code~. The following unix command should do this if ~a2-tests~ and
a2-code are in the same directory.

: cp -r a2-tests/* a2-code/

The Makefile provided is a copy of Makefile.withtests. The original
version is called Makefile.notests.

The new Makefile introduces the targets
- ~make test-p1~  : test problem 1
- ~make test-p2~  : test problem 2
- ~make test-p3~  : test problem 3
- ~make test-p4~  : test problem 4
- ~make test~  : test all problems

Test programs ~test_sortedlist1~, ~test_sortedlist2~, and ~test_undolist~
associated with problems 1-3 can run individual tests by passing a
test number as a command line argument as in

: ./test_sortedlist2 3    # run the 3rd tests only

Test program test_listmanager.sh associated with problem 4 also has
this feature

: ./test_listmanager.sh 10  # run only the 10th test
